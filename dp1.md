Design Project 1: Needfinding



## Experience 

## Observations & Interviews



## Needs
- It is necessary for multiple people to see the shared document at the same time. 
- It is necessary to unify the format of the shared document. 
- It is necessary to unify the rules for organizing shared documents.
- It is necessary to manage the shared document like a file on their computer without a separate program
- It is necessary to quickly find the desired document in shared ones
- It is necessary for them to look up a document on the mobile.
- It is necessary to manage the documents received via e-mail.
- When working together, it is necessary to share the progress of the work.
- For efficient management of information, it is necessary to hide documents that are not to be seen in the future
- It is necessary to easily share existing documents with new people who come into the lab.

## Insights
- Documents created in one way are difficult to share in other ways. 
- Most people share only the information they need rather than share all the information.
- Use different tools for different sharing purpose.
- Use different sharing channels for different sharing user.
- MANY files are sharing with mail than expected.
- Document sharing channel is more than one.  (At least, Kakaotalk and mail)
- Sharing way of simple informations and organized documents are different.
- If professor do not feel uncomfortable, there won’t any improvements, EVER.
- If they do not start document sharing from the beginning, it is almost impossible to organize the documents created before they start sharing documents.
- Needs about sharing way are totally different, as lab’s character different.
- Sharing way can be largely divided into sharing for the progress of work and sharing for archiving.
