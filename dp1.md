# Design Project 1: Needfinding

## Experience 
Redesigning the experience of sharing documents by graduate students.

??? 이 내용을 넣어야 할까요? 넣는다면 여기다 넣는게 맞을까요?
At the begging of the project, our team wanted to redesign experience about co-working.
And then, we choose graduate student as our target user population, because we expected that graduate students share documents frequently with professor or labmates in the lab.

We interviewed seven people face to face.
What we asked to people was as follow.
``` 
1. When, where, and how do you share documents?
2. Why you use that method or channels for sharing?
```

## Observations & Interviews

We wanted to hear about the sharing experiences of various graduate students.
So, We interviewed 7 graduate students with all different majors, face to face.

### Interview1 - Seungmin Lee
- Interviewee: M.S. student in Department of Materials Science and Engineering
- Observations: Rare use of computers especially on experiments. Only use computers for writing thesis, making posters or PPTs. Share documents and communicate about it by off-line.
- Interesting moments: Use network folder for archiving and sharing documents, but do not co-work with the archived document. Only finished documents are archived.
- Breakdowns: NEVER USE document sharing tools such as google drive, dropbox. And DO NOT see the necessity to introduce any document sharing tools.

### Interview2 - Seungmin Lee
- Interviewee: M.S. student in Department of Mechanical Engineering
- Observations: Interviewee E-mails to professor with attaching a document, then professor replies to decide off-line meeting appointment. Interviewee communicates with his professor almost by off-line.
- Interesting moments: He said that most of laboratories might not need document sharing tools. From morning to evening, all of the lab members stay and work together in the lab, so they prefer and think it's efficient to share the document and communicate by off-line.
- Breakdowns: NEVER USE document sharing tools such as google drive, dropbox. And DO NOT see the necessity to introduce any document sharing tools.
- Photo or Sketch: ???

### Interview3 - Seongwon Lee
- Interviewee: M.S. student in Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. She works in tiny lab.
- Observations: Interviewee shared documents rarely. Actually she don't have to share her documents with her team mates in real time with others, so her sharing experience is closer to submission than sharing. She used only mail for sharing documents. her lab mates use Kakaotalk for sharing a file, but they also only use mail and Kakaotalk. Do not use other methods never. 
- Interesting moments:
>1. Because they share many documents with mail, they set the mail sendig format of some documents. 
>2. When she and her teammates send documents to their advisor, they only use mail. They never use Kakaotalk for public affairs.
- Breakdowns: Sometimes she forget to attach a file to an email. 
- Photo or Sketch: Nope: 이메일 파일 첨부 실패하는 사진 첨부 예정

## Needs
- It is necessary for multiple people to see the shared document at the same time. 
- It is necessary to unify the format of the shared document. 
- It is necessary to unify the rules for organizing shared documents.
- It is necessary to manage the shared document like a file on their computer without a separate program
- It is necessary to quickly find the desired document in shared ones
- It is necessary for them to look up a document on the mobile.
- It is necessary to manage the documents received via e-mail.
- When working together, it is necessary to share the progress of the work.
- For efficient management of information, it is necessary to hide documents that are not to be seen in the future
- It is necessary to easily share existing documents with new people who come into the lab.

## Insights
- Documents created in one way are difficult to share in other ways. 
- Most people share only the information they need rather than share all the information.
- Use different tools for different sharing purpose.
- Use different sharing channels for different sharing user.
- MANY files are sharing with mail than expected.
- Document sharing channel is more than one.  (At least, Kakaotalk and mail)
- Sharing way of simple informations and organized documents are different.
- If professor do not feel uncomfortable, there won’t any improvements, EVER.
- If they do not start document sharing from the beginning, it is almost impossible to organize the documents created before they start sharing documents.
- Needs about sharing way are totally different, as lab’s character different.
- Sharing way can be largely divided into sharing for the progress of work and sharing for archiving.
