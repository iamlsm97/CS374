# Design Project 1: Needfinding

## Experience 
Redesigning the experience of sharing documents by graduate students.

## Observations & Interviews

Interview1 - Seungmin Lee
---
- Interviewee: M.S. student in Department of Materials Science and Engineering
- Observations: Rare use of computers especially on experiments. Only use computers for writing thesis, making posters or PPTs. Shares documents and communicates about the document by off-line.
- Interesting moments: Uses network folder for archiving and sharing documents, but do not co-work at the archived document.
- Breakdowns: NEVER USAGE of document sharing tools such as google drive, dropbox. And DO NOT see the necessity to introduce any document sharing tools.

Interview2 - Seungmin Lee
---
- Interviewee: M.S. student in Department of Mechanical Engineering
- Observations: E-mail to professor with a document, then professor replies for deciding meeting appointment. He communicates with his professor almost by off-line.
- Interesting moments: He said that most of laboratories might not need document sharing tools. From morning to evening, all of the lab members stay and work together in the lab, so they prefer and think efficient to share the document and communicate by off-line.
- Breakdowns: NEVER USAGE of document sharing tools such as google drive, dropbox. And DO NOT see the necessity to introduce any document sharing tools.

## Needs
- It is necessary for multiple people to see the shared document at the same time. 
- It is necessary to unify the format of the shared document. 
- It is necessary to unify the rules for organizing shared documents.
- It is necessary to manage the shared document like a file on their computer without a separate program
- It is necessary to quickly find the desired document in shared ones
- It is necessary for them to look up a document on the mobile.
- It is necessary to manage the documents received via e-mail.
- When working together, it is necessary to share the progress of the work.
- For efficient management of information, it is necessary to hide documents that are not to be seen in the future
- It is necessary to easily share existing documents with new people who come into the lab.

## Insights
- Documents created in one way are difficult to share in other ways. 
- Most people share only the information they need rather than share all the information.
- Use different tools for different sharing purpose.
- Use different sharing channels for different sharing user.
- MANY files are sharing with mail than expected.
- Document sharing channel is more than one.  (At least, Kakaotalk and mail)
- Sharing way of simple informations and organized documents are different.
- If professor do not feel uncomfortable, there won’t any improvements, EVER.
- If they do not start document sharing from the beginning, it is almost impossible to organize the documents created before they start sharing documents.
- Needs about sharing way are totally different, as lab’s character different.
- 공유의 방식은 일의 진행을 위한 공유와 아카이빙을 위한 공유로 크게 구분된다.
