# CS374 - DP4
### Team NanoMario

## POV
Graduate Student needs to manage the documents received on E-mail because they are sharing many files with E-mail and it’s uncomfortable.

We didn't change our POV, because our POV is still proper to us.

## Tasks
1. Write a new mail to Prof. Juho Kim, attaching a report file.
2. Find a list view of attached files, and check all attachments, and filter CS101_HW related file only.
3. Add a new tag named ‘Lab-Seminar’, and apply it to the ‘0402_lab.ppt’ file.

We also did not changed our tasks from DP3.

## Prototype
### Prototyping tool
We used Google Slides for our lo-fi prototyping. We checked all of recommended tools in DP4 introduction like Marvel, Invision, proto.io. But these tools were too advanced and had high learnability. So, it looked hard to use in a short time. So we used Google Slides, the tool which is familiar with us and easy to implement our functions in lo-fi prototyping level.

### Design choices


### Representative screenshots

![main](./main.jpg)
This is our main page. If you open our website, this page will appear at first. 
![nofile](./nofile.jpg)
If you write a mail (In prototype, the body of the message is pre-written.) and send file without attaching file, we gives a toast, underline the sentence which includes `attachment` in it. And prevent sending mail without attachments.
![yesfile](./yesfile.jpg)
If you attached file, background color is changed to light green and `Send` button is changed to red color.
![files](./files.jpg)
If you click `Files` button, it first shows list of all attachments. 
![CS101](./CS101.jpg)
A view of attachment files which is filtered by tag #CS101_HW. When a user click `New Tag` button at left down corner, he/she can add a new tag.
![newtag](./newtag.jpg)
Page for add new tag. In prototype, the textfield is pre-written.
![changetag](./changetag.jpg)
You can change tags of files when you click `+` button in file list. In prototype, you were only able to change 0402_lab.ppt's tag, adding Lab Seminar tag.

## Paper vs Digital
### 1. types of usability issues they helped identify

### 2. participants' reaction and expectation to prototypes

### 3. summarize what changes you made in the digital prototype based on the feedback from your paper prototyping testing
