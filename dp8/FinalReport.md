# CS374 - DP8
### Team NanoMario

# 1. Studio Presentation
1-1. Summarize findings from your user testing
- Many people tried to add a file at the new tag page which is empty.
- Many people did not understand what hidden button represents.
- Many people try to add a new tag by typing on ‘drop down menu of selecting a new tag’ on each file cards.

1-2. Report progress on your iteration. 

- Our goal was to fix existing bugs, and to implement new features from user testing feedbacks.
- We had fixed several bugs found on the user test.
- We took another user test to verify our prototype again.
- We tried to implement new features to resolve usability issue found on the user test period.

# 2. Final Presenation
## 2-1.  What part of the design process you want to convey to the audience

- We will show how prototypes have emerged through the overall design process, and emphasize what each of the features of the prototype is meant to be.
- Because the quality of the hi-fi prototype is quite good, we will convey the audience through the features of the prototype.


## 2-2. Which part do you think is most exciting and strongest?

- `UI screenshots or walkthrough` part might be the most exciting and strongest, because Many of the prototype's features are designed to meet user needs and address a variety of usability issues.


# 3. Iteration
## 3-1. How did you spend the DP8 period for iteration? Why?
1.  We fixed several bugs found on DP7 period. 
    
- To make our prototype running smoothly, we had to fix bugs. To finalize our prototype, we fixed bugs. 

2.  We implemented new features to resolve high and mid usability issues found on DP7 period.
   
- Our goal is to make a fine, grand, and refined prototype. So to reslove the usability issues, we make several new features and implement them.  

3. We took another user test to verify our system.
    
- Our assumption and solution to fix the usability issues might be wrong. So we took another user test to check whether we solved them correctly. 

4. We could not implement rest of the issues becuase we don't have much time to prepare the final exams.

## 3-2. What changes did you make? Show concrete examples and data whenever applicable.
### Bug Fix
1. File was not downloaded but showed on a new chrome tab

Most people afforded to download the file when click the files. We fixed it so that now it starts downloading files on `files` page when a user clicks a file card.

2. When a sender tags a file, `file view` of a receiver also has a tag but there is no tag list. (이거 창제가 구현했던건데 정확한 내용이 뭐더라..)

3. A user could not send a mail to un-registered users, i.e. a user who had never used our program.

This bug was found during the additional user test held on the iteration period.  So we've fix it.


### New features
- TODO : 새로 만든 기능들에 대해서 적어야 할듯. 그 유저빌리티 이슈 수정하기 위한 것. 이건 월요일에 마무리 정리합시다.
1. Auto tagging

A user could create a condition and a tag to add if the condition matches.

2. Notify user that mail body is empty

Actually, this feature is not related with our Point of View and HMW things. But for the improved usability experience on using prototype, we add this functionality.

3. Automatic tagging with file extension


## 3-3. What did you learn? (from the iteration)
- 뭘 배웠니?
- 서래 고기는 맛있다.
- 성원이는 잠을 잘잔다.
- 수업이 매우 알차서 주변에 강추해야겠다.
- We learned what the true design process is! By fixing several usability issues and doing a user test again, our team fully understood a design Process based on making a prototype, testing to users, finding usability issues, which is included in iteration process.
- As an iteration process repeated, the quality of prototype is getting better.
- TODO : 더 없나.
