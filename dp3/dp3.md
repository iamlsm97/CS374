# CS374 - DP3
### Team NanoMario

## Briefing
We want to give a better way to manage attachments to people who share files with e-mail.
Our solution is for people to reduce mistakes in sending emails without attachments, and to manage attachments easier with tagging.

## Tasks
1. Write a new mail to Prof. Juho Kim, attaching a report file. 
2. Find a list view of attached files, and check all attachments, and filter CS101_HW related file only.
3. Add a new tag named ‘Lab-Seminar’, and apply it to the ‘0402_lab.ppt’ file.


## Participant
* SoC Senior / Male / use gmail client
* 16’ EE Student / Female / use KAIST mail client
* 14’ SoC Student / Male / use gmail client
* 11' SoC Student / Male / use gmail client

## Observations
### Write a new mail to Prof. Juho Kim, attaching a report file.
* [High] They didn’t recognize changing background color of mail client. People does not notice weather changing the color of paper is intended or not because of paper prototype. 
  * We think it's due to limitation of paper prototype. We are going to test it on Mid-fi prototype.
* [High] Most users didn't understand why it is related to `reducing mistakes in sending emails without attachments`.
  * Our paper prototype might be work only if a user learned our features, changing color of background and a send button, and familiar with them. So we're going to consider a new task to test `reducing mistake ...` problem properly on low-fi prototype.  
* [Mid] Hard to distinguish `send` button and  `send file` button.
  * Change color of button background not text color and test it on Low-fi prototype.

### Find a list view of attached files, check all attachments, and filter CS101_HW related file only.
* [High] The user who cannot intuitively understand our new feature, doesn’t have a proper mind model. She hesitates how and what to do. After facilitator explained more, she understands our ideas and reacts as our intention.
  * Provide a simple tutorial about new feature on the first time and test it on Mid-fi prototype.
* [Mid] The reactions was different between who can and cannot intuitively understand the new feature “files list”.
  * Provide more detailed briefing and task descriptions to testers.
* [Mid] Some people was confused becuase he/she didn't recognize '#CS101_HW' was already exist. 
  * Sort tags as alphanumeric order in tag lists for user to easily find it in Low-fi prototype.
* [Low] A user without hashtag concept, understands it as directory because of layout.
  * We think that a user could understand the concept even if he/she adds thier own tag at once. So we're going to test weather user understatnd the `tag` concept properly using our system on mid-fi or hi-fi prototype. 

### Add a new tag named ‘Lab-Seminar’, and apply it to the ‘0402_lab.ppt’ file.
* [High] Because colors didn't exist between elements, a user couldn't recognize which is a button or a text.
  * On low-fi prototype, we're going to add some colors on buttons, and other elements.
* [Mid] Because "Add new tag" button is at the bottom of tag list, it took long time to find it.
  * On low-fi prototype, `Add new tag` button will be on the top of the list or proper position after doing a simple survey on target users. 
* [Low] Needs searching tag feature. He was confused because there wasn't searching feature on tag lists.
  * It will be added on mid-fi prototype. Before that, we should consider about a proper position of a search bar and it will be added on low-fi prototype.
